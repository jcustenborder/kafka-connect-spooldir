# Introduction
[Documentation](https://jcustenborder.github.io/kafka-connect-documentation/projects/kafka-connect-spooldir) | [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/jcustenborder/kafka-connect-spooldir)

This Kafka Connect connector provides the capability to watch a directory for files and read the data as new files are written to the input directory. Each of the records in the input file will be converted based on the user supplied schema. The connectors in this project handle all different kinds of use cases like ingesting json, csv, tsv, avro, or binary files.

# Installation

## Confluent Hub

The following command can be used to install the plugin directly from the Confluent Hub using the
[Confluent Hub Client](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/managing/confluent-hub/client.html).

```bash
confluent-hub install jcustenborder/kafka-connect-spooldir:latest
```

## Manually

The zip file that is deployed to the [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/jcustenborder/kafka-connect-spooldir) is available under
`target/components/packages/`. You can manually extract this zip file which includes all dependencies. All the dependencies
that are required to deploy the plugin are under `target/kafka-connect-target` as well. Make sure that you include all the dependencies that are required
to run the plugin.

1. Create a directory under the `plugin.path` on your Connect worker.
2. Copy all of the dependencies under the newly created subdirectory.
3. Restart the Connect worker.


# Source Connectors
## [Schema Less Json Source Connector](https://jcustenborder.github.io/kafka-connect-documentation/projects/kafka-connect-spooldir/sources/SpoolDirSchemaLessJsonSourceConnector.html)

```
com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.spooldir.SpoolDirSchemaLessJsonSourceConnector
```

This connector is used to `stream <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Streaming>_` JSON files from a directory while converting the data based on the schema supplied in the configuration. This connector will read each file node by node writing the result to Kafka. For example if your data file contains several json objects the connector will read from { to } for each object and write each object to Kafka.
### Important

This connector does not try to convert the json records to a schema. The recommended converter to use is the StringConverter. Example: `value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter`
### Configuration

#### Timestamps


##### `timestamp.mode`

Determines how the connector will set the timestamp for the [ConnectRecord](https://kafka.apache.org/0102/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/ConnectRecord.html#timestamp()). If set to `Field` then the timestamp will be read from a field in the value. This field cannot be optional and must be a [Timestamp](https://kafka.apache.org/0102/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Schema.html). Specify the field  in `timestamp.field`. If set to `FILE_TIME` then the last modified time of the file will be used. If set to `PROCESS_TIME` the time the record is read will be used.

*Importance:* MEDIUM

*Type:* STRING

*Default Value:* PROCESS_TIME

*Validator:* Matches: ``FIELD``, ``FILE_TIME``, ``PROCESS_TIME``



## [Json Source Connector](https://jcustenborder.github.io/kafka-connect-documentation/projects/kafka-connect-spooldir/sources/SpoolDirJsonSourceConnector.html)

```
com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.spooldir.SpoolDirJsonSourceConnector
```

This connector is used to `stream <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Streaming>` JSON files from a directory while converting the data based on the schema supplied in the configuration.
### Important

There are some caveats to running this connector with `schema.generation.enabled = true`. If schema generation is enabled the connector will start by reading one of the files that match `input.file.pattern` in the path specified by `input.path`. If there are no files when the connector starts or is restarted the connector will fail to start. If there are different fields in other files they will not be detected. The recommended path is to specify a schema that the files will be parsed with. This will ensure that data written by this connector to Kafka will be consistent across files that have inconsistent columns. For example if some files have an optional column that is not always included, create a schema that includes the column marked as optional.
### Note

If you want to import JSON node by node in the file and do not care about schemas, do not use this connector with Schema Generation enabled. Take a look at the Schema Less Json Source Connector.
### Tip

To get a starting point for a schema you can use the following command to generate an all String schema. This will give you the basic structure of a schema. From there you can changes the types to match what you expect.
.. code-block:: bash

   mvn clean package
   export CLASSPATH="$(find target/kafka-connect-target/usr/share/kafka-connect/kafka-connect-spooldir -type f -name '*.jar' | tr '\n' ':')"
   kafka-run-class com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.spooldir.AbstractSchemaGenerator -t json -f src/test/resources/com/github/jcustenborder/kafka/connect/spooldir/json/FieldsMatch.data -c config/JsonExample.properties -i id

## [CSV Source Connector](https://jcustenborder.github.io/kafka-connect-documentation/projects/kafka-connect-spooldir/sources/SpoolDirCsvSourceConnector.html)

```
com.github.jcustenborder.kafka.connect.spooldir.SpoolDirCsvSourceConnector
```

The SpoolDirCsvSourceConnector will monitor the directory specified in `input.path` for files and read them as a CSV converting each of the records to the strongly typed equivalent specified in `key.schema` and `value.schema`.
### Important

There are some caveats to running this connector with `schema.generation.enabled = true`. If schema generation is enabled the connector will start by reading one of the files that match `input.file.pattern` in the path specified by `input.path`. If there are no files when the connector starts or is restarted the connector will fail to start. If there are different fields in other files they will not be detected. The recommended path is to specify a schema that the files will be parsed with. This will ensure that data written by this connector to Kafka will be consistent across files that have inconsistent columns. For example if some files have an optional column that is not always included, create a schema that includes the column marked as optional.
### Tip

To get a starting point for a schema you can use the following command to generate an all String schema. This will give you the basic structure of a schema. From there you can changes the types to match what you expect.

.. code-block:: bash

   mvn clean package
   export CLASSPATH="$(find target/kafka-connect-target/usr/share/kafka-connect/kafka-connect-spooldir -type f -name '*.jar' | tr '\n' ':')"
